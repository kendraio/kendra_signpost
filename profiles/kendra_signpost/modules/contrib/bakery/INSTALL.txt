How to install bakery?
======================

Prerequisites: This module requires the mcrypt PHP module.

You need two Drupal sites, e.g. example.com and sub.example.com.  It
is ideal if you can copy the user base of the main site to the slave
site or if sub.example.com is a new site.

Note that "localhost" will not work in most browsers. If you wish to
test Bakery SSO locally, you must set up a local domain for it to
work.

On both domains:

1) You edit settings.php and check that $cookie_domain is set to
   example.com.

2) Login as the user with uid 1.

3) You install bakery.module.


On example.com/admin/setting/bakery you chose

a) Master site: yes

b) Master site: http://example.com/

c) Slave sites: http://sub.example.com/

d) Freshness: the default is fine

e) Key: an alphanumeric string, longer is better

f) Cookie domain: example.com

g) Supported profile fields: Any fields that you like to export. Name
   and Mail are always exported.


On sub.example.com/admin/setting/bakery you chose

a) Master site: no

b) Master site: http://example.com/

c) Slave sites: empty

d) Seconds of age before a cookie is old: you should use a number similar 
   to the value in the settings.php on the parent site.

e) Key: an alphanumeric string, longer is better (the same string as
       on example.com)

f) Cookie domain: example.com

g) Supported profile fields: Any fields that you like to import. Name
   and Mail are always imported. You can only import fields that are
   exported by the master. You can chose to ignore some of them, though.

h) You need to disable the user login block on the slave site. Log-ins
   are only permitted through the master server.

Additional slave sites can be created like sub.example.com.

Caveats
=======

If you use bakery with OG, make sure that bakery has a lower weight than OG.

If you run suhosin or mod_security you may run into trouble.
